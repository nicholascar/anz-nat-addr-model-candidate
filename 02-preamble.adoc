== Preamble

=== Abstract

[NOTE]
This Model is a candidate model for Australian & New Zealand address information. It is currently an unofficial model that is not yet published as a standard.

This model is a Semantic Web data model used for address information. It caters specifically for Australian & New Zealand's address modelling needs. It was originally was made for the Queensland Department of Resources, Spatial Information unit, to assist with future Address database design. It is informed by the ICSM's Addressing 2035: Addressing Reform and Innovation for Australia and New Zealand, published in late 2021 and is based primarilty on the ISO19160-1 _Addressing Part 1: Conceptual model_ <<ISO19160-1>> with additional elements from a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models such as GeoSPARQL <<GEO>> and SKOS <<SKOS>>. It is also informed by the relational databalse model used for the https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/d4631917-14d7-4c49-830c-555ad63adf9d[G-NAF, Australia's Geocoded National Address File], and CSIRO work in 2018 to characterise the GNAF in Sematic Web form, the ontlogy for which is online at https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf.

=== Namespaces

This model is built on a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models which use a variatey of namespaces. Prefixes for this namespaces, used througout this document, are listed below.

=== Conformance

This model conforms to the https://w3id.org/profile/ontpub[OntPub Profile] which is a specification for ontology publication that mandates certain structural and metadata properties for the model as a whole and model elements. Metadata elements for the model as a whole - the ontology - are given in the <<Metadata>> section above.
