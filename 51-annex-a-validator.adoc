[[AnnexA]]
== Annex A: Validators

=== A.1 Description
Two validators to test data claiming conformance to this model are provided as resources within this profile. The first, https://github.com/nicholascar/anz-nat-addr-model-candidate/blob/main/validator.ttl[validator.ttl] is the canonical validator for this model. The second, https://github.com/nicholascar/anz-nat-addr-model-candidate/blob/main/validator-qld.ttl[validator-qld.ttl] is a demonstration validator for Queensland that includes extended validator rules building on validator.ttl.

A summary of the canonical validator's elements ("shapes") is given in <<tbl-shapes, Table 1>>.

| Shape ID | Description

| `val:address-mandatory-properties`
| Checks the mandatory properties of `Address` instances: `addr:isAddressFor` (1), `addr:hasAddressComponent` (1+), `addr:hasGeocode` (1+)

| `val:address-component-properties`
| Checks the mandatory properties of `AddressConponet` instances: `dcterms:type` (1), `addr:hasValue` (1), `addr:hasValueText` (1, and that it's a string literal)

| `val:address-geocode-properties`
| Checks the mandatory properties of `Geocode` instances: `dcterms:type` (1), at least one of `geo:asWKT`, `geo:asGeoJSON` or `geo:asGML` must be present

| `val:address-lifecycle-stage-properties`
| Checks the mandatory properties of `LifecycleStage` instances: `dcterms:type` (1), `time:hasTime` (1)

NOTE: The canonical validator's list of elements will almost certainly grow as use of this model fleshes out model element needs.

=== A.2 Use

These validators are implemented using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) and any tool that support SHACL validation may be used to apply them to data to be validated.

Some examples of such tools are:

* https://pypi.org/project/pyshacl/[pySHACL]
** free and open source Python SHACL validator
* https://shacl.org/playground/[SHACL Playground]
** online Javascript-based validator
* http://rdftools.surroundaustralia.com/validate[RDFTools Validator]
** online pySHACL-based validator

Any of those tools may be used to apply the Canonical or Queensland validator to data and produce a report of the validity of the data.
